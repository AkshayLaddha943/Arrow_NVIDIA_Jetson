# Arrow_NVIDIA_Jetson

This repository encapsulates the ROS workspace containing the necessary packages and program nodes to simulate a simple turtlebot3 and further performing SLAM on turtlebot3 whilst adding noise to wheel odometry sensor motion model and IMU sensor. It also includes the results folder containing images and videos of simulation of turtlebot3 for different situations and a documentation as part of my Internship with Arrow Electronics (eInfochips).
